Remember that there are various flavors of this board and on Windows 10 it resolves to a CH04 USB driver.

First Install the firmware into the NODEMCU.
Flasher can be downloaded from here : https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-flasher/archive/master.zip

The firmware can be found here : https://github.com/sleemanj/ESP8266_Simple/raw/master/firmware/ai-thinker-0.9.5.2-115200.bin

After the firmware has been flashed, your PC should detect the board as a USB Serial CH340 on a COMX port. You can verify the COM port in your Device manager.

Open Arduino IDE and go over to File->Preferences and add this "https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json". Just click on OK.

Then go to Tools->Boards->Board Manager. It will update and add the required ESP8266 boards and drivers.

Once done, the board you should select is "NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module). Select the Port, Baud rate of 115200, and keep the rest at default. Once done, paste the code from the below URL.
